This repo provides the code of the manuscript: (unpublished, currently used for peer review).

The project aims to use machine learning models to describe the bonding process between atoms in alloys, in order to predict electronic structures (DOS, so far) and other related physical and chemical properties (adsorption energy, so far).

Currently, we provide a version that runs on Junpyter Notebook. (2024.07.15)
